Creating an HTML5 Game Using LimeJS 
============

I've created a series of tutorial in learning LimeJS. I'm also learning the framework and I write my mistakes, guides and other notes as a reminder to myself in the future, and hopefully as a tutorial for other developers like me. The tutorial are divided into several parts. Here are the links and the details of the discussion: 

===

[Part 1](http://rsandagon.com/html5-game-project-using-limejs/) is the basic introduction with the installation instruction 

===

[Part 2](http://rsandagon.com/html5-game-project-using-limejs/) is the basic coding semantics. It discusses on how a basic LimeJS application is structured. A basic sample scene is created for this tutorial. The codes are found in chapter3 folder of the repository.

===

[Part 3](http://rsandagon.com/creating-an-html5-game-using-limejs-part-3/) is focused on basic animation and creation of separate classes. The codes are found in chapter4 folder of the repository.
